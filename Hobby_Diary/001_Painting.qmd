What would happen if I tried to use contrast paints over TnP's (Totally_Not_Panicking)) gouache technique?

People say you should find your own style. I haven't found my style, but I'm thoroughly enjoying experimenting with other people's. 

In some ways, it would make sense to group my projects by style rather than faction or game system.
