General idea: 

In this campaign all escalation (xp, access to items etc.,) will happen as a group. Rather than xp, players are encouraged
to discuss a story narrative - a general on a winning streak can boast of better morale, of well fed horses, while recent 
losses might mean your force is feeling grim. These narrative facts don't have to be included in the rules to be reflected
on the table. 

The intention is to start as small as possible playing doubles with highly restricted lists. Your force should start at 
500 points and be as basic as your theme allows. No lord level characters, wizards level 1, no magic items, monstrous 
mounts etc., etc.,. No unit upgrades (no Big'Uns, Chosen, Veterans) initially. Paint your basic troops! Increase access to wider 
list options will occur for everyone after a set amount of games at each points value.
