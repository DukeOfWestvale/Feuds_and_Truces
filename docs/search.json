    "text": "I’ve come to the realisation that while other people seem to collect and paint based on a faction or a game system, my projects are possibly best organised by experimentation in style. For example:\nChaos Warriors, The Old World/6th Edition: A realism project focused on learning to accurately capture the look and feel of metal, but also skin and cloth. Basing is key: like model train builders, I want realistic looking bases that depict rugged farmland. I’ve mentioned in an older Hobby Diary entry that Warriors of Chaos are at their most frightening when appearing at the edge of your village (rather than depicted out in the distant Wastes). I’ve followed Koltti’s Patreon and learned a lot about this style, and managed to do a lot of it in my own way using layers of contrast paints to build up depth.\nEmperor’s Children, The Achillian Majesty: A converting project. Interesting, but ultimately one I’d consider a failure. While I did manage to build basically a full army where every model is a conversion (some of which I’m very happy with), I don’t think I met my original brief of “Mixing the insanity of Chaos with decadence”. I failed to scult anything particularly fine or detailed, I didn’t include any religious iconography or art (here I should have included extravagent banners, organ pipes, sculptures etc.,). This project also took an unexpected turn towards contrast paints, and I’m distinctly unhappy with the paint jobs on 99% of these models. I think putting this thought to page has given me permission to cannabilise these models for:\nHeretic Astartes, Renegades: Gouache and oil paints, as per Totally_Not_Panicking, though I’m not quite hitting his style - I’m no-where near as loose as he is, and I can feel it in the result. Still, I’m happy with the outcome for the initial 10 models.",

While it wasn’t exactly something I’d planned to do, Vampire Counts (for Old World) or SoulBlight GraveLords (for AoS) are something I’ve spent a fair bit of time thinking and planning on. In fact, I already own a few Soulblight models:\n\nThe start collecting box: A wight on steed, five black knights, and 20 Grave guard.\nThe Vampire Underworlds set of four models (too large for either AoS or Old world).\nThe villains and enemies from Cursed City, which is what started my initial interest in the faction.\n\nI’ve also written a fair amount of background in my previous writing format (Hobby Diary, a collection of txt documents):\n\nA character called the Soul-Time Broker, who is on their way towards Lichedom.\nThe Revered Dead: a faction for AoS.\nA general sort of idea of the Vampire Court, an eclectic mix of Vampire Nobles who are out on a hunting party. Think Aristocratic Fox or Pheasant hunt, with hounds and retainers and all members of the court out for a day of sport.\n\nRoughly, this job lot includes:\n\nVC on Zombie Dragon\nStrigoi Ghoul King\nStrigoi Ghoul King with wings (on 50mm base, therefore could be played as a monstrous Varghulf)\nBanshee\n40 Crypt ghouls\n6 Vargheists\n6 Crypt Horrors\n10 Dire Wolves\n5 Blood Knights\n\nThis already totals more than 2,000 points. When combined with my Start Collecting box (which will need to be rebased), this will be a hugely flexible project.",
